Custom Dataset with Google Open Images Dataset
-----------------------------------------------

OIDv4_ToolKit
--------------

In git bash go to OIDv4_ToolKit repository and run command:
    python main.py downloader --classes Pen Airplane --type_csv train --limit 2000

    --classes: what classes you want to download
    --type_csv: train or test (train or test folder will be created in OIDv4_ToolKit/OID/Dataset)
    --limit: how many images you want to download of each class

    folders of each class with images will end up in OIDv4_ToolKit/OID/Dataset/train


To convert labels and annotations from OIDv4_ToolKit to format that YoloV3 takes in for its training:

    python convert_annotations.py


Build Object Detection APIs Using TenserFlow and Flask
-------------------------------------------------------

1. download weights (pretrained or custom)
    /Object-Detection_API/weights
2. convert weights into a tenserflow model (.tf files)
    In Object-Detection_API run command:
        python load_weights.py
3. use this tenserflow model for our endpoints
        Update link to weights file in app.py

        Run command:
        python app.py
